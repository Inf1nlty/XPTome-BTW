## Features

- **XP Tome** item that can store up to 30 levels of XP (825 XP points).
- Deposit or withdraw XP at any time.
- New `/exp` command to check your current XP.
- Right-click a Dragon Vessel with an empty XP Tome to permanently increase the vesselâ€™s XP capacity by 1000.
- **Crafting:** To craft an XP Tome, place an Ancient Manuscript onto a Dragon Vessel, then throw a Soul Urn onto the vessel.
